-- [SETTING THE VARIABLES]
local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer
local char = player.Character
local humanoid = char.Humanoid

print("Variables Loaded!")

-- [WALKSPEED CHANGER]
humanoid.WalkSpeed = 16 --:: [DEFAULT IS 16, THE HIGHER THE NUMBER THE FASTER YOU ARE]

-- [JUMPPOWER CHANGER]
humanoid.JumpPower = 50 --:: [DEFAULT IS 50, THE HIGHER THE NUMBER THE HIGHER YOU JUMP]

print("JumpPower got set to "..humanoid.JumpPower.."!")

--[DELETE THE "--" FROM THE FOLLOWING CODE IF THE JUMPPOWER CHANGER DOESNT WORKS]
if humanoid.UseJumpPower == true then 
    humanoid.JumpHeight = 7.2 --:: [DEFAULT IS 7.2, THE HIGHER THE NUMBER THE HIGHER YOU JUMP]
    
    print("JumpHeight got set to "..humanoid.JumpHeight.."!")

end

-- [HEALTH CHANGER]
humanoid.MaxHealth = 100 --:: [DEFAULT IS 100, THE HIGHER THE NUMBER THE MORE HEALTH YOU CAN HAVE]
